# DATASETS Repository 📊

Welcome to the DATASETS repository! 🚀

### What's Inside?

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that explore three fundamental regression models: **Simple Linear Regression**, **Multiple Linear Regression**, and **Logistic Regression**. Each notebook provides hands-on examples and explanations, making it easy for you to understand these models.

### Repository Contents:

1. [simple-linear-regression.ipynb](./simple-linear-regression.ipynb) - Explore the world of Simple Linear Regression.
2. [multiple-linear-regression.ipynb](./multiple-linear-regression.ipynb) - Dive into Multiple Linear Regression.
3. [logistic-regression.ipynb](./logistic-regression.ipynb) - Understand the power of Logistic Regression.

### What You'll Learn:

- 📈 **Simple Linear Regression**: This model is used when you want to establish a linear relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. It's suitable for predicting numerical outcomes based on a single factor.

- 📊 **Multiple Linear Regression**: Unlike Simple Linear Regression, this model allows you to work with multiple independent variables simultaneously. It's used when you need to predict a numerical outcome based on multiple factors. Multiple Linear Regression considers the combined effects of these variables on the dependent variable.

- 📉 **Logistic Regression**: Logistic Regression is a classification model used when the outcome is binary (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam). It estimates the probability of the outcome being in a particular category based on one or more independent variables.

### How to Use:

1. Click on the notebook file you're interested in to open it.
2. Follow the code and explanations to understand each regression model.
3. Experiment with your own data or datasets to deepen your understanding.
4. Feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions.
