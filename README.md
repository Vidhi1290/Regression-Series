### What's Inside?

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that explore three fundamental regression models: **Simple Linear Regression**, **Multiple Linear Regression**, and **Logistic Regression**. Each notebook provides hands-on examples and explanations, making it easy for you to understand these models.

### Repository Contents:

1. [simple-linear-regression.ipynb](./simple-linear-regression.ipynb) - Explore the world of Simple Linear Regression.
2. [multiple-linear-regression.ipynb](./multiple-linear-regression.ipynb) - Dive into Multiple Linear Regression.
3. [logistic-regression.ipynb](./logistic-regression.ipynb) - Understand the power of Logistic Regression.

### What You'll Learn:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Simple Linear Regression**: This model is used when you want to establish a linear relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. It's suitable for predicting numerical outcomes based on a single factor.

- ðŸ“Š **Multiple Linear Regression**: Unlike Simple Linear Regression, this model allows you to work with multiple independent variables simultaneously. It's used when you need to predict a numerical outcome based on multiple factors. Multiple Linear Regression considers the combined effects of these variables on the dependent variable.

- ðŸ“‰ **Logistic Regression**: Logistic Regression is a classification model used when the outcome is binary (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam). It estimates the probability of the outcome being in a particular category based on one or more independent variables.

### Code Snippets:

Here's a quick look at code snippets from our notebooks:

```python
# Simple Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()

# Multiple Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()

# Logistic Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
